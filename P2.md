# A Note About P2

I said for P2 I would be less lenient about the final deliverable, and one of the teams wondered if I could go into detail. The P1s were very good and for the most part did adhere to these important principles. These are the main things that I would like everyone to be internalizing.
Firstly, how our application is layered. Most if not all P1s I looked through had a properly layered backend with API | Service | Persistence layers. We want these layers to be well defined. Services should have little to no state, all communication with the client should exist only in the API layer, and all database interaction should be entirely in the persistence layer. These layers should only be dependent on those immediately next door. So, for instance, you should be able to completely remove your API code without breaking anything in the persistence layer. (obviously the service layer would break all over the place).
Also we can take this structure and make it even more granular. Classes should be grouped into the layers, but how to we know how many and what classes we should be writing? Consider the SOLID principles:

 - Single Responsibility Principle - "A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job."
 - Open-Closed Principle
 - Liskov Substitution Principle
 - Interface Segregation Principle
 - Dependency Inversion Principle - "Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions."  

Use these principles to guide your design of classes. Most important are the first and last: Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion.  
  
Single responsibility is fairly obvious, ask yourself "Is this class doing too much?"  
  
Dependency Inversion is a little more tricky. This basically means that one class should not depend on another, instead they should both depend on some abstraction. Consider a Car class which is dependent on a Wheel class.
```
public Class Car {
    private Wheel wheel;
    ...
}
```
If you wanted to change the car to use a tank treads instead, you would have to refactor the car class. Instead, have car depend on an abstraction that represents wheels or treads.
```
public Class Car {
   private Mover mover;
   ...
}

public Interface Mover {
   ...
}

public Class Wheel implements Mover {
   ...
}

public Class Tread implements Mover {
   ...
}
```

Finally the other thing I am looking for is for us to follow the RESTful constraint about transmitting resource representations as HTTP body payloads. Any time we are transmitting something that should be persisted to or retrieved from the database it should probably be sent as an HTTP request body in JSON format, which represents a model to be translated to/from the database.

### So to recap:
 - Single responsibility principle.
 - Dependency inversion principle
 - RESTful communication
