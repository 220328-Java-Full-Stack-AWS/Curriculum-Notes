        The JS array syntax is similar but different from Java syntax. We use the square brackets,
        but don't put the parameter list in curly braces. We also don't need to explicitly type this as 
        an array like in Java (because js is loosely typed).

        We also access arrays in a similar manner, by putting the index in the square brackets

        Objects in javascript are not classes. They are similar, and as of ES6 (ECMAScript version 6, the definition 
        of the js standard) there is class syntax in JS which produces objects. We are discussing basic js object notation here.
        Objects are things stored in memory and referenced by variables, just like in Java. When we want to invoke some object
        we de-freference it just like it Java with the dot operator.
