        Functions are first-class variables, which means they can treated exactly like other variables.
        This means we can pass functions as variables in parameter lists, and we can return functions from functions.
        Why is this important? Because now we can have "callback functions".

        A callback function is a function which is passed as a parameter to be invoked later during that function, 
        usually at the end. Callback functions get used typically when we want to perform some action when another 
        action is done. This is similar to how we hook into our own code when we invert control. In Java when we wrote
        servlet classes, those classes and methods get invoked by tomcat, this is inversion of control. Callback
        functions can be used similarly, when we hand off execution to some function, we may want to have it
        perform some other function when it's complete.

        An example of this is the "pub/sub" design pattern. The pub/sub design pattern is a way to transmit data
        from one place to another. We have a "channel" which publishers write data to. And subscribers, who want 
        to receive that data, subscribe to the channel with a callback function. When data is published, all 
        registered callbacks are invoked, supplying the data to the subscriber. As a subscriber we just have to 
        write our callback function to invoke our own functionality when the data is available.
        */

        let y = 0;
        { //block scope here to enclose a "let" variable
            let x = 0;
            //here is our callback function
            function callbackFunction(i) {
                console.log("inside callbackFunction()");
                x = i;
                y = i;

        There are several ways to define functions in Javascript. The most basic way is what we've seen

        Arrow functions are anonymous and have no identifier. We can assign them and then use the reference
        but this sort of defeats the purpose. However, this is very common. What is the actual purpose? To design
        an anonymous ad-hoc function, that is to write it right in a parameter list (or similar).

        Javascript (and Java as well as many languages) are "pass-by-value" which means that when a parameter
        is passed to a function it is copied, however references that are copied still point to 
        the original object's location in memory. So below we see that we can change both
        parameters to changeFunction(), and when complete the copies go out of scope, leaving z = 5, not 6.
        But, obj was a reference to an object in memory, and the copied reference still points to it.
        So, the changes to objCopy persist.
