        JS Scopes:
        Global - available everywhere
        Function - available within the function, out of scope once the function is complete
        Block - let/const are block scoped keywords and this scope extends within a single block, 
        like an if, for, or just a bare block of brackets{}
        Lexical - Inside functions all variables that are in scope are also bound into the scope of that function.
        This means that if the function is invoked elsewhere, anything that was in scope will still be bound 
        within the funciton.
